# readme.md

This is project presents a small tutorial for a technique to automatically
store and load designated variables with minimal hassle for the programmer. The
variables can be declared normally, without massive amounts of serialization
or deserialization code. The method is not without limitations however.

The tutorial is written in [nvram.c][], this file should be viewed to see how
it works.
